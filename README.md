This is currently in pre-realease!

The mod will choose a random pack, then choose random trader images from within that pack's trader folders. If you want to disable a pack you can drag it into the .disabled folder. If you want to only have a single pack enabled, you can also disable the random_icon_pack toggle in the config and enter the folder name of the solo pack you want enabled into the force_icon_pack field.
